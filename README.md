## Background

Born out of the desire to scratch my own itch, I started this as a way to
export sent and received message data/content for both archival purposes and
for arbitrary consumption of the data. For example, exporting all messages to
or from your significant other sent via smartJailMail.com, and then importing
those messages in to a custom chat client/system.

## Install

```
$ npm install smarterJailMail@latest
```

## Usage

```js
const smarterJailMail = require('smarterJailMail');

smarterJailMail()
  .then(data => console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 4)));

```

A command-line client is installed under your global npm modules as `fetchSmarterJailMail.js`. Add said global modules path to your environment's
`PATH` for easy shell access.

**TODO(jeff):** Provide one-line info on how to initiate this build step
manually! I *think* it may be `npm add --global`. See `npm help 7 config`.
